##  Introduction

**Admin KYC Dashboard** is a real-time platform that manages and monitors driver onboarding by securely tracking login and KYC document verification processes.

---

##  Purpose

The Admin KYC Dashboard aims to eliminate manual, insecure verification systems. It empowers administrators to:

- Track driver logins and KYC submissions
- Validate uploaded documents securely
- Approve or reject driver onboarding decisions based on verified data

---

##  How It Works

### Driver Login and KPIs

When a driver signs up and logs in:

- **Login Drivers**: Indicates registered drivers, even if subsequent steps aren't completed.
- **KPIs Tracked**:
  - **L-Submission**: Tracks driver login info submission.
  - **K-Submission**: Tracks submission and approval status of KYC documents.

### Verification Status

- **V1 Approval**: Login details verified.
- **V2 Approval**: Full KYC and login information verified and matched.

---

##  Driver KYC Details Structure

### Data Layout

- **Rows**: Each row represents an individual driver.
- **Columns**: Each column represents a specific document (e.g., Aadhaar, PAN, License).

---

##  Document Verification Process

### Viewing Submitted Documents

- A üëÅÔ∏è (eye) icon is available next to each document.
- Clicking the icon previews the document via **Cashfree API** integration.

### Approving or Rejecting Documents

- Admins **must** add comments while approving or rejecting documents.
- Comments ensure transparency and auditability.

---

##  KYC Completion Measurement

- Each document is tracked to calculate a percentage completion.
- Upon reaching **100% verification**, a **final overall comment** and decision (Approved/Rejected) is mandatory.
- **Rule**: If any single attribute is rejected, the entire KYC is rejected.

---

##  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Ensures only authorized admins can access sensitive data.
- Role-based permissions include:
  - **View-Only**
  - **Verifier**
  - **Approver**
